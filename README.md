# ML_project
This report was a project during an introductory Machine Learning course.
In short, the aim of my ML models, was to be able to detect waterbodies,
using multispectral surface reflectance values. The code also reconstructs the
predicted waterbodies into .tiff images, although does not add georefencing.
The report studies and evaluates the performance of two different ML models, CNN and RFC.
The report is fairly short, with no referencing etc, as it was not required and would have
taken up a lot of space, as the maximum amount of text in the report was four pages. 
The aim of the project and report was not to produce scientific and correct text, instead 
focusing on the substance of the matter, and getting a feel for machine learning models.
